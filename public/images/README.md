## Header Image for PDF Generation

Place a file named `header.png` in this directory for use in PDF generation.

The image will be used as a header for referral PDFs and should be:

- Width: 500px (will be scaled to fit)
- Format: PNG
- Contains the company logo/branding

If the header image is not found, the PDF will be generated without it.
